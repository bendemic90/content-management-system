# content-management-system
management system: employee information, mysql db, inquirer command line interface to traverse and interact with the database.

## Features
* the ability to view tables (role, employee and department)
* add departments, roles and employees
* update an employees role

## Reasoning
Utilising inquirer to traverse and `CRUD` a database comprising of employee information (salary, role titles, etc).

## Challenges & Process
1. I found the update employee function very difficult, I'm certain that my method (although it works) is very difficult to interpret and even more difficult for me to explain. In the end I ran out of time, and considering that I met the basic functionality requirements I decided to leave it there.
